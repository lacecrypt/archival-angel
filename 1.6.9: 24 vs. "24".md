Using the correct data type is important when math operators are involved.

Strings can also be “added” together. This is called concatenation.

A substring is part of an existing string. When strings are concatenated, each separate substring is combined to create a new string. Let’s check this out!

In this exercise, change the integers in the second code segment to strings and run the code. What do you notice?

```
# numbers
num_result = 24 + 24
print(num_result)  # adds them like normal math

# strings
string_result = "24" + "24"
print(string_result)  
# whenever it's both numbers to strings, 
# it just combines the two numbers, 24 and 24 "2424."
```
