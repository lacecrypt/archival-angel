You have the opportunity to meet some droids and Wookiees!

Prompt the user for their name, then how many droids, and then how many Wookiees they want to meet. Print out the name that was given, as well as how many droids and Wookiees they wanted to meet.

Here is an example of what you should print:

Input:

What is your name?: Sean
How many droids would you like to meet?: 3
How many Wookiees would you like to meet?: 2
Output (what you should print):

Sean wants to meet 3 droids and 2 Wookiees.

```
name = input("What's your name? ")

droids = int(input("How many droids do you want to meet? "))

wookiees = int(input("How many wookiees do you want to meet? "))

print(name + " wants to meet "+str(droids)+" droids and "+str(wookiees)+" Wookiees.")
```
