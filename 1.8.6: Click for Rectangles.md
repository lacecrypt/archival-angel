Create a program that draws a rectangle whenever you click the mouse. The rectangle should have a width of 30 and a height of 50 and be centered at the place where the user clicks.

Remember, the position of a rectangle is the top left corner. To place the rectangle at the center of the click, you will need to adjust the position.

**Bonus Challenge**:
See if you can make the the color of the rectangle random!

```
import random

RECT_WIDTH = 30
RECT_HEIGHT = 50

COLORS = (
    Color.red, Color.orange, Color.yellow,
    Color.green, Color.blue, Color.black
)

def draw_rectangle(x, y):
    rect = Rectangle(RECT_WIDTH, RECT_HEIGHT)
    
    rect.set_color(random.choice(COLORS))
    
    rect.set_position(x - RECT_WIDTH / 2, y - RECT_HEIGHT / 2)
    
    add(rect)

# draw a rectangle wherever the mouse is clicked
add_mouse_click_handler(draw_rectangle)
```
