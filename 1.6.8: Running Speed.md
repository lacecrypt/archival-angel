Write a program that asks the user how many miles they ran and how many minutes it took to run that far. Ask for the input in this order!

Convert their speed to miles per hour and print out their speed.

Be sure to include comments that describe the program’s behavior which is how the program functions and how the user interacts with it.

Sample output:

How many miles did you run? 3
How many minutes did it take you? 60
Speed in mph: 3.0

```
miles = int(input("How many miles did you run? "))
minutes = int(input("How many minutes did it take you? "))

# convert minutes to hours so speed is in miles per hour
speed = miles / (minutes / 60.0)

print("Speed in mph:", speed)
```
