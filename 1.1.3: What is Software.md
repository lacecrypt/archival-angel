1. i already knew that code is basically a set of instructions for a computer to follow. i knew about the concept that it's written in a human-readable way and then eventually translated down into ones and zeros for the hardware to process.

2. i was a little surprised by the distinction the video had made between "software" as stored code in a repository vs. "software" as code that's actively being executed on a machine. i'd always thought of software in a single more general sense, so realizing that technologists use the word in two different (but related) ways was new to me.

3. i'd like to learn more about the process of converting human-readable code into the binary instructions the hardware understands. the video mentioned that it becomes ones and zeros (which are just electrical signals), but i do think that it would be interesting to learn how that translation actually works in practice, for example through compilers, interpreters, and the cpu's instruction set.

4. one question i have is how do all of the different people involved in creating software, such as designers, developers, and business representatives, actually collaborate to make sure the final product has all of the right features? i'm aware that the video mentioned teams of people working together, but i'd like to see how that actually works in practice.
