1. one activity i do extremely often is writing and taking notes (for school, work, and personal uses). fifty years ago, this was done almost entirely by hand with paper notebooks, typewriters, or index cards. while it was effective, it was also slower and harder to organize.

2. at least for me (and most other people), most of my writing is done on a laptop, typically with the aid of computer programs that can instantly check spelling, format documents, or even store thousands of notes in searchable digital archives. this has definitely been affected by computer programs, as writing is now faster, more collaborative, and infinitely more shareable than ever before.

3. in twenty years, i imagine people will still be writing, but possibly in a way that requires more immersion. maybe something like using augmented reality glasses or voice-to-text systems that make written thought nearly instantaneous, making the line between speaking and writing quite thin.

4. computer programs will likely play the role of intelligent assistants. i'm not just referring to recording our words, but also helping us to refine, organize, and fact-check them in real time, making the writing process more powerful and seamless than ever before. this is already somewhat applied with the use of llms liek chatgpt, though it definitely isn't THAT advanced (yet).
