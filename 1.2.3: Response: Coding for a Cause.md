1. Think about a social issue you care about (e.g., education, environment, mental health). Brainstorm how basic coding skills could be used to develop a solution or raise awareness about this issue. Explain your idea in a paragraph of at least 5 sentences.

1. one social issue that i care deeply about is food waste, i feel it often goes unnoticed, despite the fact that it has enormous environmental and social consequences. with basic coding skills, i would design a lightweight community-driven app where neighbors can quickly and efficiently post surplus food they don't need; whether that's leftover produce from a garden, groceries that may expire soon, or even something like extra meals from a family gathering. the program could use simple forms and a map interface to match people who have food with those nearby who could use it, helping reduce waste while also being able to foster a sense of community. a simple notification system could also alert users when food becomes available within a certain radius, thereby making the process immediate and practical. something that excites me about this idea is that it uses coding not just for awareness, but for building an actual network of sharing; turning a small skill into something that benefits not just the people, but the planet also.
