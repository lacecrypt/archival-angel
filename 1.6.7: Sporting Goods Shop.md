Write a program that asks the user how many frisbees they would like to buy, and then prints out the total cost. You should declare a constant at the top of your program called COST_OF_FRISBEE and set it equal to $15. Remember, constants should be formatted with all capital letters.

Be sure to include comments that describe the program’s behavior which is how the program functions and how the user interacts with it.

```
COST_OF_FRISBEE = 15  # price per frisbee

try:
    num_frisbees = int(input("How many frisbees would you like to buy? "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a whole number.")
    exit() 
    
# calculate total cost based on quantity entered
total_cost = COST_OF_FRISBEE * num_frisbees

print(f"The total cost for {num_frisbees} frisbees is ${total_cost:.2f}")
```
