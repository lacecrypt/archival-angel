# archival-angel : codehs archive

this repository exists as a personal chronicle of my journey in my ap cs class. you will find a complete collection of the code i have written for assignments as well as my written responses (and reflections). this serves primarily as an archive for myself, so i can preserve my early work and observe the trajectory of my growth, and then later return to trace the progress that i have made as both a learner and a thinker.

none of the material here is to be repurposed for cheating, plagiarism, or any form of academic dishonesty. it is simply a record of the process, mistakes included, and i share it with the full intent of cultivating my gradual improvement.
