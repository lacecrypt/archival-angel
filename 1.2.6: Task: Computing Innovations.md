Task Overview
Computing innovations impact our lives in ways that require considerable study and reflection for us to fully understand them.

A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.
In this activity, you will perform an online search for examples of computing innovations that have had an impact on society, economy, or culture. The computing innovations must consume, produce, and/or transform data. A computing innovation can be a physical object like a self-driving car, non-physical software like a picture editing software, or a non-physical concept like e-commerce.

Tasks:
  ▶ practice searching and evaluating sources relevant to computing innovations

  ▶ write the definition of a computing innovation in your own words

  ▶ list 5 items that ARE computing innovations and 5 items that are NOT computing innovations. For each one, explain the reason why it is or is not a computing innovation.

  definition: a computing innovation is esentially a creation that relies on computer programs to function, using data in some sort of way, whether by consuming it, transforming it, or producing new data. computing innovations can be physical (like a device), purely digital (like an online platform), or even just a concept that only exists because of computer systems.

 ౨ৎ 5 items that are computing innovations ౨ৎ

 1. crispr gene-editing software: modern gene-editing relies on computational tools to design and simulate genetic modifications. this consumes genetic sequence data and transforms it into editing instructions that are extremely precise.

 2. music reccommendation algorithms: they constantly consume listening data and produce new playlists or suggestions. this has a huge influence on how people discover new music.

 3. automated stock trading bots: these programs consume market data in real-time, process it, and make trades faster than any human ever could. this significantly affects our economy.

 4. agricultural drones w/ ai crop monitoring: these drones use computer vision to analyze crop health, consuming image data and transforming it into insights that are actionable for farmers.

 5. language translation models: they take text in one language and transform it into another.

   ౨ৎ 5 items that are not computing innovations ౨ৎ
   1. mechanical typewriter: it helps create written documents, but it doesn't consume, produce, or transform data using programs.

   2. windmill: converts wind energy into mechanical energy. however, it isn't reliant on computer programs or data processing.

   3. traditional chalkboard: very useful for teaching, but it doesn't use or transform into digital data.

   4. traditional abacus: it performs calculations, but no program or digital data is involved. it is purely mechanical.

   5. kaleidoscope: generates an infinite number of patterns, but is entirely mechanical/optical, it doesn't do this through programs or data.
